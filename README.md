This is my first project using Python's web framework, Django, to create a social media-style application or blog. 
Users will be able to sign up, and after authorization, they can create, delete, or update posts, upload images, and add comments on posts.
Additionally, I used GitHub for the first time in this project.
I currently have only one commit, which I know goes against the whole concept of version control. 
I apologize for this, but I hope you can see my progress in other projects.
